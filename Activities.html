<h1> <b><i>“Piyesa ng Deklamasyon”</i></b> </h1>
 <p> The Piyesa ng Deklamasyon was done in our Filipino 9 Subject. The Declamation to be presented was <i>"Ito ang Bayan Ko"</i> It’s a form of speech that you have to present with a tone and acting. Ms. Mei asked us to present each versions of our Deklamasyon in front of the class. While it was very anxious to present in front, and not to mention that it had to be memorized, all of us were able to successfully present. </p> <br><br><br><br>

<h1> <b><i>Extemporary Speech</i></b> </h1>
 <p> An Inaugural Speech is a form of speech that is to be presented on-the-spot on a certain topic given. This was done in English 9, and it was a graded performance task that each of us had to do. We were given the option to choose a topic from other sections to do an Extemporary, or, on-the-spot speech on. And again, we had to present in front of the class. After almost 2 weeks, everybody finished their speech and got a grade of 80% and above. </p> <br><br>

<h1> <b><i>MAPEH Music Video</i></b> </h1>
 <p> In the “Health” portion of MAPEH, we were asked to do a Music Video on the topic of ‘saving the environment’. We were only given 2 weeks to finish this project, including filming, editing, lyrics making, etc. Our M/V’s were presented to other sections and that section evaluated our Music Video. We were given the opportunity to evaluate the Music Videos of 9-Faith, while 9-Fidelity graded our Music Videos.</p>
